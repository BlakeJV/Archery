<h2 class="header">Necessary Equipment</h2>

<h2>The Bow</h2>
<img class="right" src="assets/archeryequipment.png" alt="Basic Archery Equipment" height="450" width="325">
<p>
The most important and obvious pickup is the bow. Pick a bow that is within your budget. A recommended starter bow is a <a href="https://www.3riversarchery.com/samick-sage-takedown-recurve-bow.html">recurve bow.</a> 
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>The Bow Stringer</h2>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Archery-Recurve-Bow-String-Long-bow-Stringer-Black-Microfibre-Rope-Tool/255389572?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=11232&adid=22222222227100427869&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=233348238477&wl4=pla-388645916052&wl5=9020931&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=117089434&wl11=online&wl12=255389572&wl13=&veh=sem">bow stringer</a> is a safety device for applying a bowstring to the bow. This device will make it easy to get the bow into shooting condition.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="text">Arrows</h2>
<p>
Next you'll need <a href="https://www.3riversarchery.com/3rivers-hunters-arrows-test-kit.html">arrows</a> to fire from the bow. It is recommended to buy arrows as you purchase your bow so that they are compatible.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Nocking Points</h2>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mossy-Oak-String-Nocking-Points/dp/B004VQ6170">nocking point</a> is a little device that sits on the bowstring. This will help you properly align your arrows for every shot, giving you increased consistency and accuracy.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>A Target</h2>
<p>
You have everything you need to start your archery training, but you now need a <a href="https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/morrell-nasp-youth-bag-archery-target-15morunspythtrgtxaro/15morunspythtrgtxaro">target</a> to practice with. You'll need a backstop, the thing that will stop your arrows from continuing after the target is hit. Then you can place whatever you would like on front of this backstop. From simple drawings to full animal pictures, you can make anything your target.
