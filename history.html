<h2 class="header">History of Archery</h2>
<p>
Archery is a longstanding art that began at least 5000 years ago. Archery has probably been around since 20,000 BC, but the earliest known usage of bows and arrows were the Egyptians. Archery was originally created for hunting and warfare.
<br><br> 
China hosted archery competitions and tournaments during the Zhou dynasty (1027-256 BC). Nearly a century later, the Chinese introduced archery to Japan. Archery greatly influenced the Japanese culture. A martial arts was created, now known as kyudo (way of the bow). After the development of firearms archery stopped being a weapon of war, and was used for personal ventures or hunting, as it is today.

<h2 class="header">Archery Today</h2>

<p>Medieval times saw use of the English longbow. A simple bow with a bowstring attached. It was able to fire 6 arrows per minute at a range of 300-400 yards. They were easy to make, and quite large.  <br><br>

Today, the most popular bow is the compound bow. The compound bow is smaller than the English longbow, requires less draw weight, and has a higher effective range. The compound bow is popular because of its draw curve. The draw curve drastically reduces the strength needed to pull back and hold an arrow. Additional benefits include, a peep sight and stabilizers. Peep sights help with centering and distance. Stabilizers make the bow easier to hold. The modern compound bow makes it possible and easier for most people to practice archery.
