<h2 class="header">Getting Started</h2>
<p class="header">Now that you're excited to start archery, what next? It doesn't take long to get your first arrow fired.

<h2 class="text">Step 1: Get your necessary equipment</h2>
<p>
Go to your nearest sporting goods store and mention that you want to get into archery. They'll be happy to help you get quality starting equipment. You can also go back to the "Equipment" page, there are links there to very basic starting items. Lastly, you can search for the starting items listed in the equipment page and find what works best for you. 
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="text">Step 2: Set up your equipment</h2>
<p>
After you have acquired the necessary items, attach the bow string to your bow using the bow stringer. Next, place your nocking point near the center of the string, where you'll usually be firing. Have your arrows nearby and accessible. Lastly, set up your target.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="text">Step 3: Stand back, take aim, and fire!</h2>
<p>
Everything is ready to go and set up. The last thing to do is to get ready to fire! Stand back from the target and observe your surroundings. Safety always comes first, so make sure there is no chance of hitting anything or anyone, around or beyond your target's position. Now the part you've been waiting for, take an arrow and knock it, pull back on the bowstring, aim for the center of the target, and fire!
